Re: Comments on Proposed Regulations—Gross Proceeds and Basis Reporting by Brokers and Determination of Amount Realized and Basis for Digital Asset Transactions

To Whom it May Concern,

I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the captioned proposed regulations pertaining to digital asset transaction reporting. Specifically, the proposed regulations would create (i) dangerous new cyberattack and sensitive data exploit vectors against users of digital assets, (ii) unavoidable errors and inconsistencies in the calculation of digital asset transaction bases and amounts realized which would create unnecessary tax administration inefficiencies, and (iii) reporting obligations for persons beyond Congress’s intent. 

Instead of imposing burdensome reporting obligations on software providers and developers that empower users to control their own assets and effectuate their own transactions, the proper targets of the proposed regulation would be trusted custodians and centralized exchanges to whom users relinquish control of their digital assets.

__Threats to Privacy and Safety__

The proposed regulations create new attack vectors for cybercriminals by requiring non-custodial third parties to collect sensitive personal financial and identifying information such as social security numbers (“PII”). In an era of prevalent data leaks and online scams, many users of digital asset technologies prefer such technologies specifically because they do not require the provision of control of their funds or PII to third parties. Digital asset technologies enable users to be in control of their own transactions; while basic details of digital asset transactions are publicly verifiable and viewable, anyone can use the technology without sending PII to intermediaries.

Should the proposed regulations be published, many small businesses and individual developers in the digital asset industry will likely wind down their domestic entrepreneurial activity entirely and direct their efforts abroad rather than shoulder the uncertain compliance costs and risk of handling PII. Furthermore, many website and non-custodial wallet service providers would have to collect PII from users regardless of whether such service providers ever access, handle, or control users’ funds. Many software developers who release open source code enabling digital asset transactions, over which they have no control, would now be obligated to solicit and store PII despite their lack of a direct financial interest with many users. 

This would predictably lead to increased financial crime and identity theft from phishing attacks and data leaks. It will be trivial for cybercriminals to (i) exploit the newly created centralized personal data honeypots by companies and developers that did not need to solicit nor store such PII before, or (ii) simply create malicious websites to harvest the new wealth of PII directly. Many users, especially the less sophisticated, will be susceptible not only to economic harm by scams emboldened by these prospective reporting requirements, but also potential physical harm if exposure of PII (including geographic location) is connected to their digital asset addresses.

__Inconsistent Calculations__

In addition to the PII burdens described above, the proposed regulations have inherent structural flaws that require duplicative and conflicting reporting which is counterproductive to tax collection. Currently, users easily differentiate between self-transfers (digital asset transfers between addresses they control) and transfers involving counterparties or exchanged assets in their tax reporting. When smart contracts are used, the transaction path and valuation becomes complex, but users are still able to provide tax calculations supported by the applicable blockchain’s immutable transaction record. 

However, under the proposed regulations, the agnostic providers of ownerless and noncustodial software accessed by such users would also need to report such transactions, lacking most of the users’ applicable context as to address control, valuation, and basis origination that is already reported by the users directly using reasonable methods of valuation under current law. In turn, many non-custodial software providers (including but not limited to developers of web interfaces and non-custodial wallets) would be required to provide form 1099s for an enormous number of users and transactions either without sufficient basis information or with the same self-reported information by users. Collecting such information would not only be burdensome to the providers and intrusive to the users’ privacy, but would produce an enormous number of 1099s that do not help tax collection when providers are either reporting inconsistent incomplete basis information or duplicated details already self-reported by users on their tax returns.

Just as any property can be subject to complex private legal arrangements that affect ownership and tax considerations, digital asset addresses and transactions alone do not impart enough context for basis calculation in tax reporting by software infrastructure providers. Users must self-report applicable basis information in their tax returns already—requiring private third parties to also collect such user-reported information simply duplicates paperwork without affecting the accuracy of reported tax information. 

__Congressional Intent__

From the Senate floor on August 9, 2021, Senators Portman and Warner expressly noted that the bill pertaining to these proposed regulations are intended only to require reporting by intermediary parties who sell digital assets on behalf of others, clarifying that [“For tax purposes, this means a sale on behalf of someone else… We want to be sure that miners and stakers and others who play a key role in validating transactions now or in the future, or hardware and software sellers for digital wallets, will not be subject to the rules or those activities.”](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-167/issue-144/senate-section/article/S6061-7)  The Senators stipulated that “reporting entities may be digital asset exchanges or hosted wallet providers, often called custodians,”  who are the proper targets of such regulations: centralized entities who directly effectuate custodial digital asset transactions for consideration. More simply, instead of imposing onerous reporting obligations on software providers that empower users to control and effectuate their own transactions, the proper targets of the proposed regulation would be the centralized entities whose business it is to receive digital assets from users and effectuate transactions as trusted custodians. 

Thank you for your attention to these concerns. I respectfully urge your reconsideration of these proposed regulations in favor of a more rational and efficient approach to reporting of digital asset transactions to protect against tax evasion while preserving the privacy and safety of American taxpayers.
